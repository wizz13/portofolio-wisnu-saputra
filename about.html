            <h3 class="text-black">Introducing my self</h3>
            <p>Hello, my name is Wisnu Saputra, a 20 year old young man from Kuningan, West Java, with an educational background from SMKN 1 Luragung, majoring in multimedia. Currently, I am studying at STMIK Jayakarta, majoring in informatics engineering. Since a year ago, I migrated to Jakarta to chase my dreams and pursue higher education. My experience is varied, starting from the multimedia industry, where I was involved in various projects, such as wedding organizers, cam processing, and public speaking, which is my hobby. Apart from that, I have also experienced other industrial worlds, such as F&B, pharmaceuticals, and graphic design. During my journey, I realized my strong interest and determination to pursue a career in information technology. Therefore, I continue to learn and hone my skills in programming languages such as Python and Java, in the hope of making a meaningful contribution to the industry. I believe that every experience and knowledge I have, both from educational background and work experience, will be a strong foundation for achieving future success in the information technology industry.</p>
            <p>Thank you for taking the time to read this excerpt about my background. I will share about my daily life, achievements, and challenges that I have faced. I will also tell about the people who are a source of motivation and support for me.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">Thank you for taking the time to explore my portfolio. Here, I will share my life story, including my daily life, challenges, and achievements Before graduating, I was a young person enjoying life like most people my age. I like playing football, especially futsal, while still prioritizing my schoolwork. However, after graduating, my life changed drastically. Most of my time is spent at work, with the routine of waking up in the morning, working, going home, and trying to fulfill my college obligations and study time. Ironically, time for playing and resting is becoming scarce. But that's life, I'm committed not to waste my free time</p>
            <p>I don't think... I have any proud achievements, but I believe that past failures are not the end of everything. I have the opportunity to achieve future achievements by learning from mistakes and continuing to improve myself Below I share the story of my failure in the opportunities I got ;)</p>

            <p>This is my story when I got the opportunity to join the big company PT IURIS, but I didn't pass the interview because I wasn't qualified enough in the world of IT and I was stuck in explaining myself. I was quite happy because my application was answered and I was called to do an interview session and so was I I was a little disappointed because of that failure, but from there I was determined to raise my self-worth and learn from mistakes PT Iuris is a large company operating in the finance sector.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">Thank you for still taking the time to read the story I shared, at this moment I will share about my family, my encouragement, I am the first of three siblings, my biggest motivation to achieve success is my family, economic factors and simplicity encourage me to keep going for the sake of my family, parents and my sister, my mother once said before I went abroad </p> <p><br><b> "don't be shy and prestigious in other people's cities because if you are like that your success will be hampered, and don't be jealous of your achievements because God is sure to give you the best more than other people's achievements, you are you, they are they" </b></p>
            <p>my father is a street vendor and my mother is a housewife, my first sister is 17 years old, the second is 12 years old and the youngest is 4 years old, I want to be like my father who is strong and great, he is smart in supporting his family without getting tired and I want to be like him. My mother is patient in dealing with my attitude and that of my younger siblings, gives important advice for life and supports me, and I want to be a guide or encouragement for my younger siblings, as the first child I want to be able to help my younger siblings even though in reality I am still at the bottom of my life, my family is not like the family there. especially regarding economics, but my family can balance it so that they can be like them, especially in being together for happiness</p>

            <p class="mb-4">Once again, I thank you for taking the time to read my article here is a part of the story about a woman who really influenced my life, she is my support system figure, my encouragement and encouragement, my second home to talk about complaints about achievements and other things, I met her in 2023, she had an important influence on me before. has no direction, is afraid and anxious about the future, career or love, but on the other hand, she has qualities that I don't like haha, like women in general, she is fussy, fussy, easily sulks and so on,hahahah, you must be like that too, right, just tell me yeah.</p>
            <p>he was born 2 years apart from me, more precisely on July 12 2005 haha ​​he was still small, hey, I was like that too hahaha Unfortunately we are long distance, you are quite far apart haha. Previously we were close, he was in Tasik and I was in Jakarta, but some time later he moved to Batam, 3 days, guys, if you want to play on a fairy boat, maybe it's quicker to just take a plane for 1 day, but the budget is great. haha, we've been in a relationship for quite a long time and have gone through several stages, maybe you also know what fighting, boredom, tiredness and so on, but maybe because we like each other we can lower our egos, we've only met once in the long time we've been in contact. Yes, maybe now we are given trials in distance, but I am sure and I will try to make sure that one day distance will not be an obstacle for us. he is special like my family</p>
            <p>oh yeah, usually in a portfolio it's not like this or sharing stories like this, but yes, I don't have any clients yet and there's no project yet so I will fill my portfolio like this because I think this is also important for my portfolio because you will know more about me</p>
